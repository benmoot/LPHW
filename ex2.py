# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after # is ignored by python.
print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
print "This will run."

# if a # is put inside of a string it will not be ignored
print "Hi # there."

# at this point in the program it requires a hash in front of every comment
'''
this is a multi
comment line
'''
# if ''' is in front of text it will not be ran by program
